## python3-arm-wheels

This repository contains a series of pre-built wheels for different arm architectures.
These were built on a docker container emulating the architectures via qemu or on a Raspberry Pi4 with the 64-bit version of the RaspberryPi OS.

I mainly use these wheels as a way to quickly build docker images for my python projects that have to target arm architectures.
